<div class="content"><p>Hello! You've found my page.  My name is Katie and I created this website in January 2015 as a way of teaching myself web design. But enough about my website, let's talk about me. I enjoy crossword puzzles, biking to work, the smell of fresh linens, field hockey, independent films, David Sedaris, skateboarding, and FIFA (on PS3).  Most of all, however, I enjoy all things <a href="./shea_cv.pdf" download="kqshea_cv">engineering,</a> <a href="http://www.kqshea.com/travel">exploring the world,</a> and <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/katieshea">recording music.</a></p></div>

<div class="content"><p>I graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, NY in May of 2013 with a B.S. in both Biomedical and Mechanical Engineering.  While there I performed tendon fiber engineering research under Dr. David Corr and enjoyed a summer internship at Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation as a Human Factors Engineer in Savannah, GA.  I now work at Boeing in the Los Angeles area as a Systems Engineer.  For more in-depth details, check out my <a href="./shea_cv.pdf" download="kqshea_cv">engineering projects.</a></p></div>

<div class="content"><p>I began travelling extensively during my two semesters abroad in London in the fall of 2011. I have since been addicted to the feeling of arriving in a new place that I have yet to experience.  People all over the world find different ways to satisfy even the most basic human needs: eating, sleeping, and socializing. I enjoy gaining a deeper understanding of others' cultures and sharing these experiences with my friends through my <a href="http://www.kqshea.com/travel">blog.</a></p></div>

<div class="content"><p>I dabbled with the piano and saxophone as a kid but didn't start taking music seriously until high school.  I'm largely trained by the internet and began recording myself as a way of jamming with myself for lack of musical friends. I record with an AT2035 condenser mic and an SM58 dynamic mic which hook up to my FocusRite SafirePro14 interface.  I have a MIDI keyboard by Korg (SP-250), a Fender Strat (MIM), a Yamaha F-310 acoustic guitar, my vocal chords, and a few other knick knacks that make sounds. Check out my tracks on my <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/katieshea">soundcloud.</a></p></div>
