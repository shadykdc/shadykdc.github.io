		<div class="tidbit"><span class="title">[Aortic Analysis]</span> MSc Computing students at Imperial College London spend three months working on a final project (thesis). For my degree I created a piece of software that would automatically conduct aortic segmentation and geometric calculations from a series of CT images for patients with aortic aneurysms. The ultimate goal was to cut back on the amount of time doctors spend taking measurements by hand for stent graft sizing for these patients. The final report can be found here and a copy of the presentation can be found here.

		<div class="tidbit"><span class="title">[Make Fit]</span> As a team of six Imperial College London computer scientists, my friends and I created a Windows-based application for Field Ready, an aid organization that aims to disrupt the supply chain and help remote areas prone to natural disasters receive the supplies they need for supplying water faster. The application is preloaded with various water pipe fittings which are then scaled to fit any pipes. The software generates a 3D-printable STL file.</br></br>Aid agencies in areas such as Nepal and Haiti are supplied with 3D printers capable of running on a car battery, allowing for these supplies to be printed. Otherwise, people can wait for weeks to receive the parts needed, leaving them to resort to tape, rocks, and plastic bags as fixes. The software has since been used as a demo and is now being developed further by Field Ready. MakeFit won the MSc Computing/MSc Specialism Best Group Project Prize. The presentation can be found here and the software can be downloaded here.

		<div class="tidbit"><span class="title">[Know Flow]</span> As a team of six Renssealer Polytechnic Institute biomedical engineers, my friends and I designed a device to notify care-takers if an eldery and disabled person had soiled themselves. This ultimately saves them from having to wake up the patients every two hours, carry them to another room, and check their diapers manually. The device was extremely cost effective and simple by design which resulted in our team winning the BME Showcase Best Design 2013 award.
