	<h1>Mt. Baldy Hike, Los Angeles, CA</h1>
	<h2>April 11, 2015</h2>
	
		<div class="story">
		<p>Mt. San Antonio, also known as Mt. Baldy, is the highest peak in Los Angeles County rising just over 10,000 feet.  My friends and I tried this hike a month or so ago hoping to hit the top at sunset and hike down a moonlit trail but only three out of nine of us made it to the top.  The other six of us missed the turn off onto the four mile trail which kind of messed up our whole hike, hah.  Anyways...</p>
		
		<img src="turn_mini.jpg" class="img">
		<div class="caption">The first time around we hiked along the fire road on the right, completely missing the trail that goes to the left.  Oops.</div>
		
		<p>For early april the conditions were really nice.  Temperatures were in the 50's (F) and as usual, the California sun was out all day.  The trail begins with about a mile of fire road past a small waterfall followed by about four miles and around 3,900 ft of elevation gain to the top of Baldy.</p>

		<div class="caption">I believe these trees sprout some kind of yucca flowers.  They are pretty common to the LA area trails.</div>

		<p>We took our time going up the mountain.  At first we were averaging over 2 mph but after stopping at the ski hut and all the climbing, we slowed down to almost 1 mph...</p>

		<img src="beginning_mini.jpg" class="img">
		<div class="caption">The climb was pretty steep for almost all of the four miles.</div>
		
		<p>I like hiking for the challenge and the exercise but I think I like it most for the chance to get away from the city.  LA doesn't have much plant life.</p>

		<p>Now for my favorite part of the hike!  This was a wonderful surprise to find several miles in.  The Sierra Club has a ski hut where people can come in the winter and stay for $20 per night so that they can hike up and ski the bowls.  A woman there told us it was built in the first half of the 20th century.  Single women in those days weren't allowed to sleep in the same room as men so they had to stay in the closet that now houses gear.  I believe it was called the harem.</p>

		<p>We chowed down on some snacks and refilled out water supply with fresh mountain water from the hut.  While snacking I met a friendly pup named Mika who looked like a mix of my Jovey and a pitbull.  It was amazing how similar she looked but considerably smaller.  After meeting the owner we found out that she works at Boeing!  Small world.</p>

		<p>Garrett, my friend who came all the way from San Diego to join us on the hike, was giddy with excitement.  He hopes to stay at the hut and ski with one of our friends from school sometime.</p>

		<div class="caption">The woman who was volunteering there brought out some chairs for us to sit in.  The view was nice and the company was great!  Especially Mika, woof.</div>
		
		<p></p>
		
		<img src="losttrail_mini.jpg" class="img">
		<div class="caption">Almost got lost at this point, hah.</div>
		
		<p>We were somewhat close to losing the trail but only at one point really.  The rocks became so thick that it became difficult to pick out a particular trail but we found our way easy enough to the next part of the trail.</p>
		
		<img src="snow_mini.jpg" class="img">
		<div class="caption">We soon spotted our first sight of snow!  For April there wasn't much.  It has been a dry winter but it was fun to play with a bit of it.</div>

		<p>We saw a lot of twisted trees so Kevin decided to take a photo in one.  Lauren also needed to throw her snowball as her annual winter experience.  We continued on through the final leg of our journey to the summit.  The trail was still incredibly steep at this point so we were pretty slow going.</p>

		<div class="caption">Looking back at the last plateau we reached before the summit.</div>
		
		<p>We followed an older man up the majority of the trail after almost losing the trail that one time.  He gave us a lot of helpful tips along the way concerning the trail since you can pretty much go whichever way you want.</p>

		<p>While this hike was pretty difficult for us despite being active young 20-somethings, it wasn't as bad as Mt. Wilson.  Some say Wilson is easier because the elevation is less.  I would say I felt the elevation a little after 9,000 ft. but since I only drank 1 liter of water throughout the entire hike (11 miles), there is also a good chance I was just dehydrated.  I'm bad at drinking water =/  Anyways, matbe I was more prepared for this one but I think it was easier than Wilson.  There were two 76 year old men who did the hike that day.  Mika also did it... all by herself...</p>

		<p>Kevin and I made a small snowman at the summit to plant my Maryland flag in.  The flag was a gift from my neighbors back home.  I carry it with me to the top of every mountain.</p>

		<div class="caption">Maryland Snowman</div>
		
		<p>There were a ton of people at the top, maybe about 40.  As I got my Maryland flag out I heard a voice call out from across the summit, "IS THAT A MARYLAND FLAG?!"  A fellow marylander sprinted over to bring it in for a hug.  He was a friendly, muscly ginger who graduated from the Naval Academy in 2010 and was stationed in San Diego.</p>

		<p>We once considered hiking Baldy but a random snow storm came in the day before so we cancelled.  Greg said the trail can be pretty risky if covered in ice or snow.  As you can see by the photos above, it would be tough to know exactly where the edge is with a foot or more of snow.</p>

		<img src="topofchairlift_mini.jpg" class="img">
		<div class="caption">Top area of the first chairlift</div>
		
		<p>From the top of the mountain it was 2 miles to the top of the first chairlift we saw.  Another 1.2 miles later we hit the Ski Lodge and from there it was just 3.7 more miles to the bottom.  The hike down was pretty easy after we got past the backbone--it's pretty much all fire road from the top of the chairlift.</p>

		<img src="garrett2_mini.jpg" class="img">
		<div class="caption">The Ski Lodge</div>
		
		<p>The skiing area isn't much but it looks pretty decent for being so close to LA.  As far as I know, they don't make any snow; it's o' natural.  If you want to get to the top the easy way, you can take the chairlift up to the ski lodge and hike the 3.2 miles to the top.  The Ski Lodge isn't a bad place for a meal or a beer either.</p>

		<img src="indianrun_mini.jpg" class="img">
		<div class="caption">Casual indian run on the way down to the parking lot.</div>
		
		<p>We realized it was about time for us to get to the bottom of the mountain so rather than sauntering down we all walked in a line and, indian run style, had the last person in line run to the front.  We made it down from the ski lodge in about an hour.</p>
