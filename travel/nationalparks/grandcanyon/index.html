	<h1>Grand Canyon National Park, AZ</h1>
	<h2>November 27, 2014</h2>
	
		<div class="story">
		<p>I've only spent two Thanksgivings away from home and the Grand Canyon was one of them.  Any time I had to picture about the Grand Canyon in my head, I always thought of little Joe Dirt being left behind but this trip allowed me to create my own memories of the wonder place.  To say the least, the Grand Canyon is, well, grand and certainly worth visiting.  My plan for the trip was fairly altered by my less than desirable travel companion so I'll have to go back to hike to the bottom sometime.  Check out some photos I took below and maybe even read the story.</p>
		<p>For my full itinerary, scroll to the bottom or <a href="#itinerary">click here.</a></p>

		<p>I set off from LA with Danny after work on Tuesday and headed for Phoenix.  We didn't spend much time there but I wanted to see it just to see it.  We stayed in a Motel 6 near ASU in Tempe that was only $50 for the night for two and gas there was incredible cheap.  That morning we grabbed a few supplies from Target and then drove to our first hike in Sedona, AZ.</p>

		<p>Sedona was a great place for a quick stop on the way to the Grand Canyon.  The hike up to Cathedral Rock required some scrambling but was fairly short and not too strenuous.  We mostly picked it out to get a chance to warm up our hiking muscles and stretch our legs in the middle of the car ride.</p>

		<p>Our next stop was Flagstaff for some lunch.  We went to a Hawaiian BBQ place that was alright and then stopped into the Flagstaff Brewery for a quick pint.  I chatted with a fellow who was delivering the beer and asked him if he was ready for Thanksgiving.  He replied, "Yeah I just killed my turkeys yesterday."</p>

		<p>We arrived at the Grand Canyon shortly before sun set and went to set up our tent before it got too dark.  Unfortunately by the time we made it to the backpacking center to see about reserving a site at the bottom of the canyon for the next night, they were already fully booked.  Apparently the Grand Canyon is very popular during the holidays--especially Thanksgiving day!  So if you're ever heading there, just make the reservations online.  The ranger said we'd be alright hiking the whole thing in one day since we looked fit, we would just run out of daylight.  So we planned to wake up at 6am and hit the trail.</p>

		<p>6am was our plan but when I woke Danny up he said it was too cold (somewhere below 30 so not really too cold for hiking) and he wasn't going to get out of his sleeping bag until it was warmer.  When it comes to travelling I try to pick my battles so I didn't push it too hard.  We left the tent a couple hours later and started down the South Kaibab trail around 8am or 9am instead.</p>

		<p>The trail down to Skeleton point only took us about 3 hours round trip.  The later in the day it became, the more people we saw on the trail.  The worst of it is definitely the switchbacks at the end, hah!</p>

		<p>The views were of course fantastic.  It seems the landscape changes quite a bit as you traverse the trail.  You'll find yourself on the other side of a hill or closer to the bottom and have a totally new perspective.</p>

		<p>We made it to Skeleton Point and paused for a bit to take in the view of the river.  It was still pretty far away--perhaps 2,000 ft of elevation and several miles of trail--but I had a small sense of accomplishment nonetheless.</p>

		<p>The hike back up was certainly more difficult than coming down but it wasn't too bad.  The worst was definitely the end.  We got to pass a lot of pack mules on our way up though.  They can be hired to walk people up or down the canyon.  There is also a lodge at the bottom of the canyon for people who don't want to hike down with tents.  I believe it is about $50 per person so it just might be worth it if you don't care to carry your tent and sleeping bag up 5,000+ ft. ;)</p>

		<p>Once we made it back to the Grand Canyon Village we stopped at the cafe and had a full Thanksgiving turkey dinner for only $11.  It was pretty tasty and filling.</p>

		<p>Once we cleaned up a bit and changed our clothes we stopped over at the Desert Watchtower which was a bit like a small museum.  We then headed back to camp and watched the sunset there while cookin up some smores.</p>

		<p>We got pretty bored too so we started taking pictures of the fire and guessing what shapes they looked like.</p>

		<p>We passed the Desert Watchtower again on our way out.  In hindsight we could have gone there on our way to Zion but this way we weren't in a rush.  It was a nice building with great views of the Grand Canyon and a few tid bits of information to read about.  Certainly worth the stop I would say.</p>

		<p>Once we were on the road again we made our first stop at Horseshoe Bend.  It is in Arizona and is technically a part of the Grand Canyon but it really isn't very close to either the south or north rim.</p>

		<p>The sun hadn't quite reached high noon so we didn't get particularly good photos of it.  I did enjoy taking photos of the ground though.  There were rocks like those below by the bend but the entire trail leading up to it was mostly sand.</p>
