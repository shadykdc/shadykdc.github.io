		<p>The trail down to Skeleton point only took us about 3 hours round trip.  The later in the day it became, the more people we saw on the trail.  The worst of it is definitely the switchbacks at the end, hah!</p>

		<div class="caption">This photo was taken from a little ways up the switchbacks that start the observation point trail off.  You can actually see observation point in the photo; it is the small red square on the peak on the right.</div>
		
		<p>The views were of course fantastic.  It seems the landscape changes quite a bit as you traverse the trail.  You'll find yourself on the other side of a hill or closer to the bottom and have a totally new perspective.  I hope I get to go back sometime for a hike to the bottom!</p>

		<p>We made it to Skeleton Point and paused for a bit to take in the view of the river.  It was still pretty far away--perhaps 2,000 ft of elevation and several miles of trail--but I had a small sense of accomplishment nonetheless.</p>

		<p>We passed the Desert Watchtower again on our way out.  In hindsight we could have gone there on our way to Zion but this way we weren't in a rush.  It was a nice building with great views of the Grand Canyon and a few tid bits of information to read about.  Certainly worth the stop I would say.</p>
